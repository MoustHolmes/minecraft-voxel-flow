# 🚨 CLOUDFLARE BLOCKING YOU? Try These Solutions!

## 🎯 Quick Solutions (In Order of Effectiveness)

### 1️⃣ BEST: Stealth Chrome (Recommended) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

```bash
# Install stealth driver
pip install undetected-chromedriver

# Run stealth version
python scripts/run_scraper_stealth.py --start 5654 --end 26538
```

**Why this works:** Specifically designed to bypass Cloudflare!

---

### 2️⃣ GOOD: Firefox with Your Profile ⭐⭐⭐⭐

```bash
# Close ALL Firefox windows first!
python scripts/run_scraper.py --start 5654 --end 26538
```

**Why this works:** Uses your real browser profile (cookies, history) - looks human!

---

### 3️⃣ OKAY: Slower Scraping ⭐⭐⭐

```bash
# Add longer delays
python scripts/run_scraper_stealth.py --start 5654 --end 26538 --delay 2.0
```

**Why this works:** Less suspicious request pattern.

## 🔧 What We Fixed

### Before (Old Script)
```python
driver = webdriver.Firefox()  # Obvious bot
time.sleep(0.5)  # Too fast!
```
❌ Cloudflare easily detects this

### After (New Script)
```python
# Option 1: Real Firefox profile
driver = webdriver.Firefox(profile=your_real_profile)

# Option 2: Stealth Chrome
driver = uc.Chrome()  # Undetected!

# Smart waiting
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(...)  # Human-like
```
✅ Much harder to detect!

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:

python scripts/run_scraper_stealth.py --start 5654 --end 26538 --delay 2.0
