# 🎯 Scraper Enhancement Summary (v2)

## 🆕 What's New in This Update

### 1. 📦 `.litematic` File Support
**Now supports THREE file types:**
- ✅ `.schematic` (original format)
- ✅ `.schem` (newer format)
- ✅ `.litematic` (Litematica mod format)

The scraper automatically detects and handles whichever format is provided.

### 2. 💰 Paid Schematic Detection
**Automatically skips paid "non-free" schematics:**
- Detects the text: "This creation is marked as 'non-free'"
- Marks as `paid_schematic` in CSV
- Saves time by not attempting to download
- No wasted API calls or failed downloads

### 3. 🔍 Detailed Error Logging
**New `error_message` column in CSV provides:**
- Exception type and full error message
- For file not found: Lists recent files in Downloads folder
- For redirects: Shows where it redirected to
- For timeouts: Explains what timed out

**Example error messages:**
```
NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: //a[contains(text(), 'Download')]
File not found with extensions ['.schematic', '.schem', '.litematic']. Recent files: temp.zip, 1234.schem
Redirected to https://www.minecraft-schematics.com/
```

### 4. ⚡ Intelligent Page Loading (WebDriverWait)
**Replaced arbitrary `sleep()` with smart explicit waits:**

#### Before (Old Way):
```python
driver.get(url)
time.sleep(0.5)  # Maybe enough? Maybe not? 🤷
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'html.parser')
```
❌ Fixed 0.5s wait - too short for slow connections, too long for fast pages

#### After (New Way):
```python
driver.get(url)
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, "h1"))
)
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'html.parser')
```
✅ Waits intelligently - proceeds as soon as element appears (or fails gracefully after 10s)

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Faster**: No unnecessary waiting when pages load quickly
- 🛡️ **More Reliable**: Waits longer for slow connections (up to 10s)
- 🎯 **Smarter**: Waits for actual DOM elements, not arbitrary time
- 📊 **Better Errors**: Timeout exceptions are logged with details

## 📊 Updated CSV Structure

The metadata CSV now has 12 columns (was 11):

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| id | Schematic ID | 1824 |
| title | Schematic name | Medieval Castle |
| category | Category | Buildings |
| theme | Theme | Medieval |
| size | Dimensions | 64x128x64 |
| submitted_by | Username | BuilderPro |
| posted_on | Upload date | 2023-05-15 |
| downloads | Download count | 1,234 |
| description | Full text | A magnificent castle... |
| local_filename | Actual file saved | 1824.litematic |
| status | Result status | downloaded |
| **error_message** | **Detailed error info** | **File not found...** ← NEW! |

## 🔄 New Status Codes

| Status | Meaning | Action Needed |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `downloaded` | ✅ Success | None |
| `not_found` | ❌ Doesn't exist | Normal - ID may be deleted |
| `paid_schematic` | 💰 Requires payment | None - auto-skipped |
| `file_not_found` | ⚠️ Downloaded but missing | Check error_message |
| `auth_required` | 🔐 Login expired | Re-run with login |
| `download_failed` | ❌ Click failed | Check error_message |
| `page_load_timeout` | ⏱️ Page too slow | Network issue |
| `download_page_timeout` | ⏱️ Download page too slow | Network issue |
| `error` | ❌ Other error | Check error_message |

## 🎬 Example Improvements in Action

### Example 1: Paid Schematic
**Before**: Would try to download, fail, mark as `download_failed` ❌
**After**: Detects on page load, skips immediately, marks as `paid_schematic` ✅

### Example 2: Fast Connection
**Before**: `sleep(0.5)` waits unnecessarily on fast connection
**After**: Page loads in 0.1s, WebDriverWait proceeds immediately 🚀

### Example 3: Slow Connection
**Before**: `sleep(0.5)` times out, page not loaded yet ❌
**After**: WebDriverWait waits up to 10s, page loads in 2s ✅

### Example 4: File Not Found
**Before**: 
```csv
1234,Castle,Buildings,Medieval,...,N/A,file_not_found,
```
No idea why! ❓

**After**:
```csv
1234,Castle,Buildings,Medieval,...,N/A,file_not_found,"File not found with extensions ['.schematic', '.schem', '.litematic']. Recent files: temp.zip, 1233.schem, config.ini"
```
Aha! It downloaded as something else! 💡

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Speed
- **Same or faster** than v1 (explicit waits are adaptive)
- **Skips paid schematics** - saves ~1-2s per paid schematic
- **Fewer failures** - better waits = fewer timeouts

### Reliability
- **More robust** - handles slow connections better
- **Better diagnostics** - error messages help debug issues
- **Clearer results** - know exactly why each schematic failed

## 🚀 How to Use

Everything works the same as before:

```bash
# Quick test
python scripts/test_scraper.py

# Full run
python scripts/run_scraper.py --start 1824 --end 19000
```

The improvements are automatic - no configuration needed!

## 📋 File Type Detection Order

When looking for downloaded files, checks in this order:
1. `{id}.schematic` (most common)
2. `{id}.schem` (newer format)
3. `{id}.litematic` (Litematica mod)

Whichever is found first is used and recorded in `local_filename`.

## 🔍 Debugging Failed Downloads

With the new `error_message` column, you can now:

```bash
# See all errors
grep -v "^downloaded" data/schematics_metadata.csv | cut -d',' -f11,12

# See specific error types
grep "file_not_found" data/schematics_metadata.csv

# See what files were actually in Downloads when a file wasn't found
grep "Recent files:" data/schematics_metadata.csv
```

## ✨ Summary of All Changes

| Feature | v1 | v2 (This Update) |
|---------|----|----|
| File types | `.schematic`, `.schem` | + `.litematic` ✨ |
| Paid detection | ❌ No | ✅ Yes ✨ |
| Error logging | Status only | + Detailed messages ✨ |
| Page loading | Fixed `sleep()` | Explicit waits ✨ |
| Reliability | Good | Better ✨ |
| Speed | Fast | Same or faster ✨ |

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

All improvements are live in:
- `src/minecraft_voxel_flow/scrape_scheme.py` (core function)
- `scripts/run_scraper.py` (CLI script)
- `scripts/test_scraper.py` (test script)

No breaking changes - all existing code still works!
